      <p>
        Combining a passion for coding with a background in music, I bring a
        fresh and creative approach to full-stack development. After completing
        Dev Academy Aotearoa's intensive 17-week bootcamp, I’ve gained a solid
        foundation in coding, working in an environment that mirrors real-world
        software development. This experience involved over 700 hours of
        hands-on coding, including the use of Git, modern web frameworks,
        relational databases, test-driven development, and unit testing.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        Beyond the world of tech, I’ve spent over a decade as a professional
        musician. I currently create and perform with Flamingo Pier
        and The Raw Honey’s. My background in music has shaped me in ways that
        complement my journey as a developer. The creativity, collaboration, and
        problem-solving required in both industries have made me adaptable and
        driven in every project I take on.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        I’m excited to bring this unique perspective to a dynamic development
        team, blending technical expertise with the collaborative mindset and
        creative flair I’ve developed throughout my musical career.
