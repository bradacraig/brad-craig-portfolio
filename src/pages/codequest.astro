        `CodeQuest is a simple interactive multichoice quiz to help fledgling developers brush up on JavaScript concepts. The idea was to create something that Dev Academy foundations students could use as a study aid before making the transition into bootcamp.`,
        `This was built during a friday group project at Dev Academy. These projects have a time limit of one day so have a bit of a hack-a-thon feel to them. I worked as part of a team of 5 students and took on the role of product owner, as well as writing some of the front end code.`,
